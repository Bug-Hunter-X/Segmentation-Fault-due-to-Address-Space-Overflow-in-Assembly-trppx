mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, four times the value in ECX, and 0x10.  However, if ECX is very large, the resulting address might exceed the available memory space, causing a segmentation fault or general protection fault.
